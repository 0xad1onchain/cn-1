## Installing on a MAC(Traditional methods are tough, trust me).
I have written a script to install NS2 on a **mac** with a single line of code to eliminate the hassle.

## Pre-Requisites:
Xcode
[Xquartz](https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg)

Steps:
1. Open a terminal of course.
2. **git clone https://github.com/ashwanijha04/cn**
3. The command will create a folder in your working directory. It will also give you the redundant programs but why not? You'll need it. You want to pass, right?
4. **cd cn**
5. **chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh**
6. Restart terminal. Don't think. Just do it.
7. Now run the nam files.
8. Send me a thank you. Follow me.
